# Executive Summary

This report documents a Business Analysis project undertaken to review and improve the application and recruitment process within a Salesforce environment. The project was completed during a professional internship and focused on identifying inefficiencies, system constraints, and opportunities for process optimisation.

The organisation relied heavily on manual processes, informal knowledge sharing, and inconsistent system usage. Key challenges included limited process documentation, manual and delayed applicant follow-ups, Salesforce custom field capacity constraints, and redundant or conflicting workflow logic. These issues increased operational effort, reduced system clarity, and introduced risks to data quality and reporting accuracy.

As the Business Analyst, I conducted an end-to-end analysis of the application lifecycle, working closely with technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand current workflows, pain points, and business needs. The analysis informed a series of targeted initiatives, including business process mapping, communication workflow improvement, Salesforce data management, and workflow optimisation.

The solutions proposed and implemented aimed to reduce manual effort, improve data integrity, and enhance system usability while maintaining a positive applicant experience. Ethical and data protection considerations were incorporated throughout the project, particularly in relation to automated communication and personal data handling.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of core business analysis practices to deliver practical, value-driven improvements within a real-world Salesforce environment, while balancing operational efficiency, system governance, and stakeholder needs.
