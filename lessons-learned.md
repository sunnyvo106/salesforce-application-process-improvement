# Lessons Learned

## 🧠 Key Lessons

### 1. Requirement Clarity Is Critical
Early assumptions led to rework when stakeholder expectations were later clarified. This reinforced the importance of confirming problem statements, success criteria, and scope before progressing into solution design.

**What I would do differently:**  
Validate requirements explicitly with key stakeholders before implementation, even when solutions appear straightforward.

---

### 2. Stakeholder Alignment Drives Success
Different stakeholders viewed the same problem through different lenses. Open discussion and iterative feedback helped uncover misalignment and guided the solution toward real business value rather than technical perfection.

---

### 3. Automation Must Reflect Business Reality
Not all processes benefit from full automation. In this project, stakeholder feedback revealed that controlled, intentional automation provided more value than fully automated workflows.

---

### 4. Data Governance Matters
System limits and unused fields highlighted how unmanaged data growth creates technical debt. Proactive data analysis and cleanup are essential to maintain system scalability and reporting confidence.

---

### 5. Iteration Improves Outcomes
Multiple solution attempts were required to arrive at effective Salesforce flows. Iterative testing, troubleshooting, and refinement were key to delivering a performance-safe and reliable solution.

---

### 6. Documentation Is a Strategic Asset
Consistent documentation of processes, decisions, and assumptions made it easier to revisit work, explain solutions to stakeholders, and support future onboarding.

- Translate business problems into structured analysis
