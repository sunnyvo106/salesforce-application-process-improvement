# Value Contribution and Next Steps

## 📌 How I Contributed Business Value

Throughout this project, I contributed value by applying business analysis practices to real operational challenges within a Salesforce environment. My focus was not only on identifying issues, but on ensuring that proposed solutions were practical, feasible, and aligned with stakeholder needs.

Key contributions included:

- **Improving process clarity:**  
  By documenting the end-to-end application process, I reduced reliance on informal knowledge and supported faster onboarding and shared understanding across teams.

- **Reducing manual effort:**  
  Workflow improvements and controlled automation reduced repetitive manual tasks for recruitment staff while maintaining appropriate human oversight.

- **Improving data quality and system scalability:**  
  Analysing and identifying unused Salesforce fields helped address system limits, reduced technical debt, and enabled future enhancements.

- **Supporting better decision-making:**  
  Cleaner workflows and clearer data structures increased confidence in reporting and operational visibility.

- **Balancing efficiency with user experience:**  
  Ethical and GDPR considerations were embedded into solution design to ensure applicant communication remained accurate, intentional, and respectful.

Overall, my contribution helped the organisation move toward a more sustainable, efficient, and well-governed use of Salesforce.
