# Business Problem Statement

## 📌 Overview
The organisation uses Salesforce to manage its application and recruitment process. While the system supports core operational needs, a number of process and system limitations have reduced efficiency, clarity, and data quality over time.

These challenges became particularly evident during onboarding, day-to-day recruitment operations, and system maintenance, highlighting the need for a structured review and optimisation of the existing process.

## ❗ Key Business Problems Identified

### 1. Lack of Process Documentation
There was no formal documentation outlining the end-to-end application process, including key stages, required fields, and decision points. New staff relied heavily on informal knowledge transfer, increasing onboarding time and operational risk.

---

### 2. Manual and Inconsistent Applicant Follow-Ups
Applicant communication relied on manual checks and ad-hoc follow-ups. The absence of structured workflows or tracking mechanisms resulted in delayed responses, inconsistent communication, and reduced visibility over application progress.

---

### 3. Salesforce System Constraints
The Salesforce Application object had reached its custom field capacity. This limited the organisation’s ability to respond to new business requirements and increased the risk of system rigidity and technical debt.

---

### 4. Redundant and Conflicting Workflow Logic
Multiple fields and workflows existed to capture similar information, leading to confusion, data duplication, and inconsistent reporting. Some workflows relied heavily on staff judgment and manual correction.

---

### 5. Data Quality and Governance Risks
Unused fields, unclear ownership of data elements, and inconsistent updates reduced confidence in reporting accuracy and made system maintenance more complex.

---

## 🎯 Business Impact
If left unaddressed, these issues would continue to:
- Increase manual workload for recruitment staff
- Slow down onboarding and application processing
- Limit system scalability and flexibility
- Reduce confidence in data and reporting
- Increase operational and compliance risk

---

## 🔍 Problem Context Summary
These problems were not caused by a single system failure, but by incremental growth of processes and system configuration over time. A structured business analysis approach was required to clarify the current state, validate stakeholder needs, and design practical, sustainable improvements.
