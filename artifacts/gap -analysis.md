# GAP Analysis – Applicant Communication (Project 2)

## 📌 Overview
A GAP analysis was conducted to compare the current state of applicant communication within Salesforce (As-Is) with the desired future state (To-Be). The purpose was to identify inefficiencies, duplication, and opportunities to improve accuracy, efficiency, and user experience without introducing unnecessary automation.

## 🔍 GAP Analysis Table

| Aspect | Current State (As-Is) | Future State (To-Be) | Identified Gap |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Process | Manual review of applications and multiple email templates | Controlled, streamlined email generation with clearer logic | Heavy reliance on manual effort and staff judgement |
| Email template usage | Multiple templates with duplicated or outdated versions | Single, dynamic email template with conditional content | Time-consuming and error-prone template selection |
| Automation | Limited automation, mostly manual email sending | Targeted automation triggered intentionally by staff | Inefficient use of Salesforce capabilities |
| Personalisation | Generic emails with broad checklists | Personalised emails based on specific missing requirements | Emails lack clarity and relevance to applicants |
| Efficiency | Multiple emails per applicant per request | One-click email generation per applicant | Unnecessary repetition and staff workload |
| User experience (staff) | Searching and selecting correct templates | Simple, consistent workflow | Frustrating and inconsistent experience |
| User experience (applicant) | Unclear or generic requests for documents | Clear, specific communication | Confusion about required next steps |

## 🎯 Outcome
This GAP analysis highlighted that full automation was not the optimal solution. Instead, a **trigger-based, personalised email approach** better addressed the identified gaps while maintaining accuracy, reducing staff workload, and avoiding applicant confusion.
