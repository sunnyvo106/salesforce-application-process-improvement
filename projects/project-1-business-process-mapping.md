# Project 1: Business Process Mapping

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focused on documenting and visualising the end-to-end application process within Salesforce to address a lack of system clarity and onboarding challenges for new staff.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
When joining the organisation, there was **no written documentation** explaining:
- How applications flow from the web portal into Salesforce
- Which objects, record types, and statuses were involved
- What fields were required at each stage

This resulted in:
- Slow onboarding
- Knowledge silos
- High reliance on verbal explanations

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create a shared understanding of the application lifecycle
- Document key Salesforce objects, record types, and statuses
- Provide reusable process documentation for future onboarding

---

## 🔍 Analysis Approach
- Explored the **Application object** in Salesforce
- Identified key fields per application status
- Analysed record types and transitions
- Validated findings with Salesforce Admin

---

## 🛠️ Solution
- Created **swim-lane process diagrams** using Draw.io
- Documented:
  - Application stages
  - Required fields per status
  - Decision points and handovers
- Produced clear visual artefacts for internal use

---

## ✅ Outcome & Value
- Faster onboarding for new team members
- Improved shared understanding across teams
- Reduced dependency on individual knowledge holders
- Foundation created for future automation initiatives

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Salesforce
- Draw.io
- Miro
- Confluence

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Process visibility is critical before automation
- Visual documentation accelerates stakeholder alignment
- Business process mapping reduces operational risk
